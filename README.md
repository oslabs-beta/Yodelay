# Yodelay.io

Your preferred gRPC endpoint testing tool. Yodelay is a browser based testing tool for all types of gRPC calls: unary, server streaming, client streaming and bi-directional streaming.

## Getting Started

For an overview of gRPC in general, checkout the official [DOCS](https://grpc.io/docs/) here. There are clear and simple walkthroughs for each of the 12 programming languages supported by gRPC. Butter, Yodelayâ€™s furry mascot, recommends choosing your preferred language, uploading the .proto file into yodelay and then using those examples to walk through this readme.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubhandle>/Yodelay.git
```
```sh
cd Yodelay
 ```
 ```sh
npm install
```
### Test your endpoints locally:

Navigate to the Yodelay folder in your terminal and run the following command:
```sh
npm start
``` 
NPM start will build the bundle, make it available in your browser at localhost:3000, start the client server on port 4000, and start a demo grpc server at localhost:8080
 
Go to your browser and enter the URL: 
```sh
0.0.0.0:8080
``` 

To test our demo proto file, upload the demo.proto file in the /protos folder
 
Input the server ip address:
```sh
0.0.0.0:8080
``` 
Select Service from the drop down you want to test:

Select Request from the drop down menu you want to test:

Edit your input message so it matches the gRPC server fields:

Click on the Send Request button and see the results from your gRPC call!
